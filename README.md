Compiled cosmology data sets for easy access: <br />

1. Hubble expansion rate: `Hdz_2020_CConly.txt` and `Hdz_2020_BAOonly.txt` were compiled in [arXiv:2111.08289](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08289) <br />
2. Growth rate data: `Growth_tableII.txt` and `Cij_WiggleZ.txt` were compiled in [arXiv:1803.01337](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01337) <br />
3. PTA correlation measurements: `ng125orf.txt` was obtained from the [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/AaronDJohnson/12p5yr_stochastic_analysis/blob/master/tutorials/optimal_stat.ipynb) for the NANOGrav 12.5 year data set ([arXiv:2009.04496
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04496)). <br />
